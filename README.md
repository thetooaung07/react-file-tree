# React File Tree

**React File Tree** is a **React-based application** that allows users to upload local `folders` and view them in a beautiful tree structure. This project aims to provide a *user-friendly interface* for navigating through file directories. 

The best part?

- It's **smoothly animated** unlike typical npm libraries, making your experience seamless and enjoyable.
